Piece Parent class
- contains functionality of ALL our pieces. 
- utilizes move method
- will be inherited by all different types of pieces

    -hold reference to current state of the board
    -track position of that piece

In order to get different types of pieces
- create modules to separate different characteristics 
 1. Slideable - move multiple spaces in a single turn
    - implement #move_dirs, which will be used by #moves
    
 2. Stepable - set moving pattern for that piece

 3. NullPiece - singleton

Finally, make pawn class

REFACTOR


subclass < class
knight < piece
superuser=subclass(takes in all attributes of user) < user=class
Of course, every piece will move differently, so you can't write 
(implement) the #moves method of Piece without subclasses.
- if we are creating a class that we know has specific subclasses, 
    we create subclasses first, because classes need to work consistently
    in all subclasses
